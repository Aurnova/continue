# You're all set

- **Continue** is configured with **Qwen3 Coder Next** (OpenRouter). No login, no API key, no model picker.
- **Copilot** is disabled and uninstalled in this devcontainer.

**To chat:** click **Continue** in the left sidebar, or press **Ctrl+L** (Mac: **Cmd+L**). The model is already selected.

**If Continue asks for a key or Copilot still appears:** run **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) → **Codespaces: Rebuild Container**. After the rebuild, the config is copied into the container and Copilot is removed.
